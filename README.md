Code used for Oqarpunga: A Hybrid Translation System for the Translation of Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) Verbs 

## Installation: 
Use the command mamba env create -f environment.yaml to set up the necessary virtual environment.

## Description: 
This code uses a hybrid translation system for Greenlandic verbs. It consists of an LLM to convert dictionary entries into usable templates,
and deterministic algorithms which convert a conjugated Greenlandic verb into its English translation. It also contains built-in functions to calculate the ChrF (character frequency)
and semantic similarity scores compared to a gold translation, and runs a loop that performs these benchmarking tests over a larger test set.

## Running: 
Just simply run the code in the Colab notebook Final_Project.ipynb in order
